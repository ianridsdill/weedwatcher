## description

playing around with a raspberry pi to monitor conditions inside the greenhouse. the goal is to have constant monitoring of temperature, humidity in the air as well as detect whether soil is dry or not. values will be logged in an SQLite database and served up via web application. 

- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- usb battery bank with solar powered trickle charge
- breadboard
- AM2 302 temperature + humidity sensor
- [kuman 5PCS Soil Moisture Sensor Module Kit](https://www.amazon.ca/Kuman-Moisture-Compatible-Raspberry-Automatic/dp/B071F4RDHY/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1QQ3OLZZFPSRA&keywords=moisture+sensor+raspberry+pi&qid=1656445763&sprefix=moisture+sensor+raspberry+pi%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-5)
